    <h2>Revolutionize Your Study Experience</h2>
    <p>At Eidos, we’re revolutionizing the way you study by harnessing the power of spatial memory. Traditional flashcards fall short when it comes to subjects that require deeper, interconnected understanding. <br>
       That’s where our interactive canvas comes in. Inspired by neuroscience, our web app allows you to organize and navigate information in space—creating a network of knowledge you can easily explore with your keyboard. By placing concepts in relation to one another, we help you build a more intuitive and lasting understanding. <br>
       Whether you’re memorizing facts, studying complex systems, or simply seeking a more engaging way to learn, Eidos offers a smarter, more interactive study experience.
